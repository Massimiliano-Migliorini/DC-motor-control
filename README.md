# DC-motor-control
 DC Motor Control for Tramway Applications - Project for the course "Dynamics of Electrical Machines" at Politecnico di Milano

 ## üöÄ Project Summary
Individual project carried out as part of the ‚ÄúDynamics of Electrical Machines and Drives‚Äù course at Politecnico di Milano.

‚Ä¢ Developed a complete control scheme for a real-world tram system powered by four DC motors, modeled as a single equivalent separately-excited DC machine.

‚Ä¢ Derived missing mechanical and electrical parameters based on technical data and constructed a realistic simulation model of the motor-tram system.

‚Ä¢ Designed and implemented a cascade PI control architecture to ensure accurate tracking of a 10‚ÄØkm reference speed profile, accounting for varying track slopes and vehicle loading conditions.

‚Ä¢ Built a detailed Simulink model including torque and speed control loops, excitation control, anti-windup strategies, and actuator saturation.

‚Ä¢ Tuned PI controllers in MATLAB based on the cascade control principle, ensuring decoupled and stable system response.

- `report.pdf`: detailed technical report (EN)
- `DC_motor_script.m`: MATLAB implementation
- `DC_motor_simulink.slx`: Simulink simulation

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Simulation
To execute the full simulation workflow:

1. **Run the MATLAB script**  
   Open `DC_motor_script.m` in MATLAB and run it. This script initializes all necessary parameters and populates the workspace.  
   You can freely modify the parameters in the script to explore different system behaviors.
2. **Open and run the Simulink model**  
   Launch `DC_motor_simulink.slx` and click **Run**.  
   The system response will be displayed directly in the embedded **Scope** block.

NB: Make sure to run the MATLAB script **before** the Simulink model, so that all variables are correctly defined in the workspace.
