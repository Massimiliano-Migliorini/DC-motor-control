 DC Motor Control for Tramway Applications - Project for the course "Dynamics of Electrical Machines" at Politecnico di Milano

Individual project carried out as part of the “Dynamics of Electrical Machines and Drives” course at Politecnico di Milano.
• Developed a complete control scheme for a real-world tram system powered by four DC motors, modeled as a single equivalent separately-excited DC machine.
• Derived missing mechanical and electrical parameters based on technical data and constructed a realistic simulation model of the motor-tram system.
• Designed and implemented a cascade PI control architecture to ensure accurate tracking of a 10 km reference speed profile, accounting for varying track slopes and vehicle loading conditions.
• Built a detailed Simulink model including torque and speed control loops, excitation control, anti-windup strategies, and actuator saturation.
• Tuned PI controllers in MATLAB based on the cascade control principle, ensuring decoupled and stable system response.
