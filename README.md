 DC Motor Control for Tramway Applications - Project for the course "Dynamics of Electrical Machines" at Politecnico di Milano

 ## 🚀 Project Summary
Individual project carried out as part of the “Dynamics of Electrical Machines and Drives” course at Politecnico di Milano.
• Developed a complete control scheme for a real-world tram system powered by four DC motors, modeled as a single equivalent separately-excited DC machine.
• Derived missing mechanical and electrical parameters based on technical data and constructed a realistic simulation model of the motor-tram system.
• Designed and implemented a cascade PI control architecture to ensure accurate tracking of a 10 km reference speed profile, accounting for varying track slopes and vehicle loading conditions.
• Built a detailed Simulink model including torque and speed control loops, excitation control, anti-windup strategies, and actuator saturation.
• Tuned PI controllers in MATLAB based on the cascade control principle, ensuring decoupled and stable system response.
